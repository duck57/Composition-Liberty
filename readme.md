#Composition of Liberty

* One of the first pieces I wrote (2006 or somesuch).
* More of a sketchpad than acual composition
* The name "Liberty" is from the fact that it is unmetered (though in tempo and not real free time)
* Better title would be "Unmetered Sketch (AD 2006)"
* I put it into LilyPond just because I could (was probably before I discovered MuseScore)
* Definitely has borrowed/inspired melodies & chord progressions
